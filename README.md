##Background

Async Art was the first place the impact of the global cryptoartist network became real for me.  Where I first connected to Alotta Money. Rest in Power

Spring and summer 2020, connections between digital artists were spreading like mycelium. Phillipe recruited me to his team for one of three panels in the first Kitty Bungalow Cat Rescue Charity Auction, a mega-collaborations with 34 artists that stress-tested the platform.  Our concept was martial arts so I created the Shaolin Sphynx character and wrote the lore of the project - [Big Trouble in Māo Māo City](https://beta.cent.co/asyncart/+e5fa33)  The auction raised over $30,000 usd.

Later an an Async artist, I created an homage to Mexico through a re-imagining of Diego Rivera's classic response to censorship by the Rockefeller family -  Man COntroller of the Universe
